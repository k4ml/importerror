Being a developer/programmer, site such as Reddit (especially [r/programming][1]) and
[HackerNews][2] are my main source of latest news and updates. Next definitely Stackoverflow when looking for answers on specific programming problems. But from time to time, I'd
also discovered few other small communities, mostly country focused while going through the google search results. So I've decided to start collecting link to these communities in this blog posts.

So here are the lists so far:-

* [nullpointer](http://nullpointer.ph/) - Q&A like site in Phillipine.
* [Hackstreet.India](http://hackerstreet.in/) - India based site.

While not an Q&A site, I listed also here site with domain of similar theme:-

* [Hackflow](http://hackflow.com/) - Blog mostly on Python.
* [ImportError](http://importerror.com/) - This very own site ;)
